# The Misty Path

You take a deep breath and step onto the foggy path. The mist wraps around your ankles like ghostly hands, and a chill runs down your spine. Towering trees stand overhead, their shadows dancing strangely in the dim light.

As you continue walking, the silence is broken only by the sound of the crunch of leaves beneath your feet. Time seems to lose meaning in this spooky landscape.

Suddenly, you notice three distinct features in your surroundings:

1. To your left, you hear the sound of running water, barely through the thick fog.
2. Straight ahead, a tiny, distant light flickers, like a beacon in the mist.
3. To your right, you spot an ancient, gnarled tree with a hollow large enough to crawl through.

The path splits, presenting you with a crucial decision. What will you do next?
