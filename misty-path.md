# Misty Path

You take a deep breath and step onto the foggy path. It's pretty spooky, I've gotta say. The mist wraps around your ankles like ghostly hands, and man, it's getting chilly out here. Those trees? Huge. And in this light, their shadows look like something out of a horror movie.

You keep walking, and walking, and walking some more. Feels like you've been out here forever.

Just when you're ready to call it quits, the path splits. Great, now what? Hold on - is that water you hear off to the left? Sounds pretty far off, though. And wait a second, what's that tiny light way over on the right?

What will you do next?
